                <h3> A little bit about us:</h3>
                <p>Drogheda Animal Rescue was established in 1997 in Drogheda, County Louth, Ireland by a small group of volunteers concerned with animal welfare. Today, Drogheda Animal Rescue remains as a non-profit, 100% voluntary organisation committed to providing shelter and care to abandoned, strayed, neglected, abused, and injured dogs, cats, wildlife and other companion animals.</p>
                <p>All of the animals in our care, who are old enough, will be neutered before being rehomed as we support neutering as a means to control unwanted litters of puppies and kittens. We also run a year-round Trap Neuter Return (TNR) programme to aid in reducing the feral/stray cat overpopulation.</p>
                <p>All our dogs are also microchipped prior to rehoming to comply with legislation on microchipping. All potential new homes & owners are vetted to ensure that the animals will be well looked after and cared for by their new owners. We constantly seek to instil responsible dog & cat ownership into the public and raise the awareness of animal welfare in Ireland.</p>
                <p>It is our policy not to put a healthy animal to sleep. If an animal has a serious injury, terminal illness, or is deemed a danger or risk to the public, we will then have that animal put to sleep upon careful consideration and recommendation by our vets & animal behaviourists, or into long-term/palliative foster care.</p>
                <p>As with many charities, DAR relies heavily on fundraising to survive, and the global situation with Covid-19 has made it impossible for a number of our usual fundraising events to take place. Your support will enable us to continue our work in the community, and to raise much needed funds, all of which go directly towards the costs of the animals in our care.</p>
